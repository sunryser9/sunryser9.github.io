      <guid>https://javayou.com/posts/monolith-to-microservices-with-spring-boot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The Evolution of Modern Applications&#xA;For years, the monolithic architecture served as the backbone of countless enterprise applications. It�s a single, cohesive unit where all components�data, business logic, and UI�are tightly coupled. While this approach is simple to develop and deploy initially, it presents significant challenges as an application scales.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive guide will walk you through the journey of migrating a monolithic Spring Boot application to a resilient, scalable microservices architecture. We�ll cover the strategic decisions, technical challenges, and the role of Kubernetes in orchestrating this modern deployment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;beyond-chatgpt-building-intelligent-llm-agents-and-tool-using-applications-in-java-with-spring-ai&#34;&gt;Beyond ChatGPT: Building Intelligent LLM Agents and Tool-Using Applications in Java with Spring AI&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome back, fellow Java innovators! In our last guide, we explored the foundational power of Generative AI and how Spring AI makes it incredibly easy to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into your Java applications. We touched on generating text, summarization, and basic Q&amp;amp;A. But what if you want your LLM to do more than just generate text? What if you need it to fetch real-time data, interact with your internal APIs, or perform complex, multi-step actions?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;optimizing-jvm-metaspace-for-dynamic-class-loading-in-spring-boot-microservices&#34;&gt;Optimizing JVM Metaspace for Dynamic Class Loading in Spring Boot Microservices&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome, advanced Java architects and site reliability engineers! In the complex landscape of modern microservices, especially those built with Spring Boot, ensuring predictable and stable performance is paramount. While heap memory is often the primary focus of optimization, the &lt;strong&gt;Metaspace&lt;/strong&gt; � where the JVM stores class metadata � frequently becomes an overlooked villain, silently leading to &lt;code&gt;OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace&lt;/code&gt; in long-running or dynamically evolving systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;jvm-monitoring-and-performance-tuning-a-comprehensive-guide-for-production-java-applications&#34;&gt;JVM Monitoring and Performance Tuning: A Comprehensive Guide for Production Java Applications&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome, Java engineers and site reliability experts! In the demanding world of production applications, simply writing functional code isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. The true test of a robust Java application lies in its &lt;strong&gt;performance, stability, and resource efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; under real-world load. And at the heart of every running Java application is the &lt;strong&gt;Java Virtual Machine (JVM)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Optimizing the JVM is often the most critical, yet frequently overlooked, aspect of ensuring your Java applications run smoothly, consume fewer resources, and scale effectively. This comprehensive guide from JavaYou.com will demystify JVM monitoring and performance tuning, providing you with the knowledge and tools to keep your production Java applications running at peak performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Have you ever found yourself wrestling with a massive codebase, where a tiny change in one part of the system seems to ripple unpredictably through another? Or perhaps scaling a single component means scaling the entire monolithic application, even if only one small feature is getting all the traffic? If any of this sounds familiar, then the world of microservices is calling your name.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
